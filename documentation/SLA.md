## SLA – Whoknows

**Date:** 4 December 2025  
**Project:** Whoknows

---

### 1. What this service is

- **What we provide**: Access to the Whoknows for our users.
- **Main features**: Login, registration, search, and the main pages of the app.
- **Maintenance**: If we plan work that might break the app, we’ll try to let people know about **48 hours** before.

---

### 2. How well it should run

- **Uptime**: We aim for about **99.5%** uptime each month (not counting planned maintenance or big issues on the internet that we can’t control).
- **Speed**: Under normal conditions, most pages and actions should respond in around **1 second** on our side.
- **Backups**: We back up data at least **once a day** and keep backups for about **7 days**.

### 3. When something breaks

- **Big problems** (site down or core features like login not working):
  - We try to react within **1 hour** and aim to fix or at least reduce the impact within **4 hours**.
- **Medium problems** (major feature broken for many users):
  - We try to react within **4 business hours** and aim to fix it within **1 business day**.
- **Small problems** (minor bugs, visual issues):
  - We try to react within **1–3 business days** and fix them as part of our normal updates.

### 4. How we handle security

- We use logins and sessions so only the right people can access their accounts.
- We use **HTTPS** so data between the user and the app is encrypted.
- We try to protect stored data using common, well-known security practices.
- Only people who need it for their work should have access to user data.

---

### 5. Rules and privacy

- We try to follow relevant privacy and data protection rules (for example **GDPR** if it applies).
- We only use personal data for running and improving the app, not for random other things.
- If the project ever ends, we aim to delete or anonymize user data within a reasonable time, unless we legally have to keep it.
