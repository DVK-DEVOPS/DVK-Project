# DVK-Project - What is it?
The DVK Project is a mirror repository of Whoknows Variations for use during the 4th semester DevOps elective(2025) at EK(formerly KEA). 

The goal is to rewrite a legacy project using traditional DevOps tools and adhering to DevOps principles.


The requirements to run this project will be reflected in the [requirements.txt](path/to/requirements.txt) which will be authored later.

## The Legacy Project
Peruse the documentation regarding running and installing the legacy project [here.](documentation\legacy_codebase\README.md)


**Below is the original readme file from the WhoKnows repository.**
## Whoknows Variations - Repository ReadMe

This is the Whoknows variations repository. It is not meant for production as it contains several security vulnerabilities and problematic parts on purpose. 

### How to get started

Each branch is a tutorial in a different topic based on the same Flask application as in the `main` branch. 

One way to follow along is by:

1. Forking the repository to your own account.

2. Cloning the repository to your local machine.

3. Checking out the branch you are interested in (e.g. `git checkout <branch_name>`).

4. Following the instructions in the README of the branch.

5. You can now push changes to your own repository. 

### Pull requests

If you have any suggestions or improvements to the tutorials, feel free to open a pull request.
